            Being from the State of Odisha, Bhubaneswar, I learned Chess from my
            father at the age of 9 years. My father being a Railway employee
            usually spends some of his leisure at evening time playing Chess
            with their friends in a Railway Club. I started wondering at his
            Game play and slowly gained attraction towards the Smart thinking in
            Chess. Gradually I participated in local tournaments and performed
            well. My father encouraged me and while I was winning trophies, it
            gave me an immense pleasure and happiness. Through this article, I
            would like to share some of my thoughts on the topic 'Benefit Of
            Chess' which would highlight some of the key nuances of game.

            Chess is one of the best sports to exercise the brain. While Chess
            Grandmaster Bobby Fischer made it popular in the 1950s and 1960s,
            the game is still widely played around the world today among
            participants of all ages, from the young to the elderly. The game of
            chess might not help you build your biceps or tone your abs, but
            your lifelong mental health can certainly benefit from it. It is a
            great hobby to pick up and perfect! Teach your kids to play chess at
            home during your downtime social distancing. Number 1 Fitness
            trainer in America, Samir Becic recommends chess as the best brain
            exercise to play while social distancing. Chess is the best game to
            play with your family, especially your kids while at home due to the
            COVID pandemic. Besides improving your cognitive skills, it allows
            you to better cope with the current situation because it improves
            your problem-solving skills and occupies the mind in a positive way.
            There are different ways, Chess helps to improve individuals
            thinking ability. It Promotes brain growth: Games like chess that
            challenge the brain actually stimulate the growth of dendrites, the
            bodies that send out signals from the brains neuron cells. With more
            dendrites, neural communication within the brain improves and
            becomes faster. Think of your brain as a computer processor. The
            tree-like branches of dendrites fire signals that communicate to
            other neurons, which makes that computer processor operate at a
            fast, optimal state. Interaction with people in challenging
            activities also fuels dendrite growth, and chess is a perfect
            example.

            It exercises both sides of the brain: A German study indicated that
            when chess players were asked to identify chess positions and
            geometric shapes, both the left and right hemispheres of the brain
            became highly active. Their reaction times to the simple shapes were
            the same, but the experts were using both sides of their brains to
            more quickly respond to the chess position questions. Raises your
            IQ: Do smart people play chess, or does chess make people smart? At
            least one scientific study has shown that playing the game can
            actually raise a persons IQ. A study of 4,000 Venezuelan students
            produced significant rises in the IQ scores of both boys and girls
            after four months of chess instruction. So grab a chess board and
            improve your IQ! Helps prevent Alzheimers: As we age, it becomes
            increasingly important to give the brain a workout, just as you
            would every other major muscle group, in order to keep it healthy
            and fit. A recent study featured in The New England Journal of
            Medicine found that people over 75 who engage in brain-games like
            chess are less likely to develop dementia than their
            non-board-game-playing peers. The saying use it or lose it certainly
            applies here, as a sedentary brain can decrease brainpower. Sparks
            your creativity: Playing chess helps unleash your originality since
            it activates the right side of the brain, the side responsible for
            creativity. One four-year study had students from grades 7 to 9 play
            chess, use computers, or do other activities once a week for 32
            weeks to see which activity fostered the most growth in creative
            thinking. The chess group scored higher in all measures of
            creativity, with originality being their biggest area of gain.
            Increases problem-solving skills: A chess match requires fast
            thinking and problem-solving on the fly because your opponent is
            constantly changing the parameters. A 1992 study conducted on 450
            fifth-grade students in New Brunswick indicated that those who
            learned to play chess scored significantly higher on standardized
            tests compared to those who did not play chess.

        About planning and foresight: One of the last parts of the brain to
        develop during adolescence is the prefrontal cortex, the area
        responsible for judgment, planning and self-control. Because playing
        chess requires strategic and critical thinking, it helps promote
        prefrontal cortex development and helps teenagers make better decisions
        in all areas of life, perhaps keeping them from making an irresponsible,
        risky choice. Optimize memory improvement: Chess players know that
        playing chess improves your memory, mainly because memory recall needed
        when trying to avoid previous mistakes or remembering a certain
        opponents playing style. Good chess players have exceptional memory
        performance and recall. A study of Pennsylvania sixth-graders found that
        students who had never before played chess improved their memories and
        verbal skills after playing. Improves recovery from stroke or
        disability: Chess develops fine motor skills in individuals who have a
        disability or have suffered a stroke or other physically debilitating
        accidents. This form of rehabilitation requires the motion of chess
        pieces in different directions (forward, backward, diagonally forward
        motion, diagonally backward motion), which can help develop and
        fine-tune a patients motor skills, while the mental effort required to
        play the game can improve cognitive and communication skills. Playing
        can also stimulate deep concentration and calm, helping to center and
        relax patients who are experiencing different degrees of anxiety. At the
        end I would like to thank everyone interested in learning about Chess
        and growing passion on knowing about the game and its benefits. Today
        Chess has brought many people across the nations together and create new
        thinking among the new generation.
